# Double-Pendulum
Animation of a double pendulum. 

I solved the motion of a double pendulum by finding coupled differential equations via Lagragian Mechanics and then solved them numerically using SciPy's odeint function. I also plotted the Kinetic and Potential energies onto an animated graph. I have attached animations in mp4 format.
